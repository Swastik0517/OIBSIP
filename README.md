***Task 1***: June – Python Voice Assistant

June is a Python-based voice assistant that can greet you, listen to your commands, and respond using speech. It can perform tasks like searching Wikipedia, opening websites such as Google and YouTube, and telling the current time. The assistant uses SpeechRecognition to understand voice commands and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech responses.

How it Works:

When you run June, it first greets you based on the current time. It then continuously listens to your voice commands through the microphone. Commands are converted to text using the SpeechRecognition library. Based on your command, June can fetch information from Wikipedia, open web pages, or tell the current time. You can stop the assistant at any time by saying “exit,” “quit,” or “stop.”

To use June, clone the repository, install the required Python packages, and run the program. Speak commands like “Open Google,” “Search Wikipedia for Albert Einstein,” “What is the time?” or “Exit” to interact with the assistant.

***Task 2***: BMI Calculator

A simple command-line BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator written in Python. This program allows users to input their weight in kilograms and height in feet to calculate their BMI and determine their health category.

The calculator uses the standard BMI formula:
BMI = weight (kg)/height (m)^2

Since height is entered in feet, the program automatically converts it to meters before calculating the BMI.

Features:
1. Input weight in kilograms and height in feet.
2. Automatic conversion from feet to meters.
3. Calculates BMI and displays it rounded to two decimal places.
4. Classifies BMI into categories:
    -Underweight
    -Normal weight
    -Overweight
    -High BMI
5. Handles invalid or non-numeric inputs gracefully.
